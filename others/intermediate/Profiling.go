/*
Profiling is a technique for analyzing the performance of a program by collecting data about its execution. In Go, you can use the built-in profiling tools to gather information about the runtime performance of your program.

The Go standard library includes several profiling packages, including:

runtime/pprof: a package for collecting and analyzing CPU and memory profiles.
net/http/pprof: a package for serving profiling data over HTTP.
Here's an example of how to use the runtime/pprof package to gather CPU profile data:
*/


package main

import (
    "log"
    "os"
    "runtime/pprof"
)

func main() {
    f, err := os.Create("cpu.prof")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    defer f.Close()

    if err := pprof.StartCPUProfile(f); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    defer pprof.StopCPUProfile()

    // Your program code here...
}

/*
In this example, we create a file called cpu.prof to store the CPU profile data. We then call pprof.StartCPUProfile to start collecting CPU profiling data, and pprof.
StopCPUProfile to stop the profiling and write the data to the file.

You can then use the go tool pprof command-line tool to analyze the profile data:

 	go tool pprof cpu.prof

This will launch an interactive shell where you can explore the profile data and run various commands to analyze it.

Note that profiling can have a performance impact on your program, so it's important to use it judiciously and only when necessary. Additionally, it's important to remember that profiling data can be difficult to interpret and should be used in conjunction with other performance analysis tools to get a complete picture of your program's performance.
