# Security Guidelines for Go Programms samples Repository
At the Go Programms samples Repository, we take the security of our code and our users' data very seriously. To maintain the highest level of security, we ask that all contributors follow these guidelines when submitting code to the repository:

## Encryption
All sensitive information, such as passwords and API keys, must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption Go Programms samples. Do not store plain-text passwords or keys in your code. Instead, use secure storage options such as environment variables or a key management system.

## Input Validation
All input to the code must be validated to ensure that it is of the correct format and within acceptable ranges. This helps to prevent injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities.

## Code Review
All code submitted to the repository must be reviewed by at least two other contributors before being merged. The reviewers should carefully examine the code for any potential security issues or vulnerabilities.

## Third-Party Libraries
Any third-party libraries used in the code must be carefully evaluated to ensure that they are secure and trustworthy. Libraries that have not been updated in a long time, or that have known vulnerabilities, should be avoided.

## Testing
All code should be thoroughly tested to ensure that it is working correctly and that there are no security vulnerabilities. Automated testing should be used wherever possible to reduce the risk of human error.

## Reporting Security Issues
If you discover a security issue or vulnerability in the repository, please report it to the maintainers immediately. Do not publicly disclose the issue until it has been resolved.

By following these guidelines, we can work together to maintain a secure and reliable repository for Go Programms samples.
