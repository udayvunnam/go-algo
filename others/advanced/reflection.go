/*Reflection is a powerful feature in Go that allows you to inspect and manipulate the type and value of variables at runtime. It is particularly useful when working with unknown types, such as those passed in as interface{} values.

In Go, reflection is implemented using the reflect package, which provides functions and types for working with types and values at runtime.

Here's an example of how to use reflection to get the type of a variable and print its name:*/

package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "reflect"
)

func main() {
    var x int = 42
    fmt.Println(reflect.TypeOf(x).Name()) // Output: int
}

/*
In this example, we define a variable x of type int. We then use the reflect.TypeOf function to get the reflect.Type object representing the type of x. We can then use the Name method of the reflect.Type object to print the name of the type.

Here's another example that demonstrates how to use reflection to modify the value of a variable:
*/

/*
```Go

package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "reflect"
)

func main() {
    var x int = 42
    fmt.Println(x) // Output: 42

    v := reflect.ValueOf(&x).Elem()
    v.SetInt(100)

    fmt.Println(x) // Output: 100
}
```


In this example, we define a variable x of type int. We then use the reflect.ValueOf function to get the reflect.Value object representing the value of x. We use the Elem method of the reflect.Value object to get a mutable value of x. We can then use the SetInt method of the mutable value to modify the value of x.

Reflection can be a powerful tool, but it should be used judiciously. In general, it is better to use Go's static type system whenever possible, as it provides better type safety and performance. Reflection should be used only when there is no other way to accomplish a task, or when working with unknown types or dynamic data.
